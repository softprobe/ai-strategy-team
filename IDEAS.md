## Open Source Claude Code

Claude Code is a powerful AI OS. It's AI based goal-driven, todo list based task break-down and orchestration is powerful. 
It's not just useful for programming. We have seem many use cases such as generating presentation decks. 

More importantly, Softprobe is aim to build an AI based ETL product for enterprise. ETL itself is essentially a programming
problem, which analyzes source JSON schema, design a data warehouse table schema, and write Python code to convert JSON into
tabluar format. This process will be interactive process between AI agents and human users.

We could build the product direct from Claude Code SDK. However, having an in-house developed Claude Code give us full control.
We could also gain traction by open source this product.
