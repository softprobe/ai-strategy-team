  - Create schema validation and structure analysis functions
  - Document core functionality and API design

- [ ] **Python ETL Code Generation Engine** (3-4 hours)  
  - Design template system for ETL code generation
  - Implement basic JSON‚ÜíPython transformation logic
  - Create warehouse schema mapping (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift)
  - Test with sample JSON data from common APIs

- [ ] **CLI Interface Foundation** (2 hours)
  - Set up basic CLI structure using Click or Typer
  - Implement core commands: analyze, generate, validate
  - Create help documentation and usage examples
  - Test end-to-end workflow: JSON input ‚Üí ETL code output

## Medium Priority (Important, Not Urgent)

### üìù Strategic Documentation (2-3 hours)
- [ ] **Technical Architecture Documentation**
  - Document system design and component architecture
  - Create API specifications for core functions
  - Plan integration points for Claude Code SDK

- [ ] **GitHub Repository Setup**

- [ ] Family time boundaries maintained

## Tomorrow's Preparation

### üìã Monday September 2 Preview
- Continue ETL engine development
- Begin comprehensive documentation
- Research Claude Code SDK integration points
- Plan technical blog post content

## Notes & Reminders

- **Energy Management**: Start with most complex tasks (JSON schema analysis) during peak morning energy
- **Family Protection**: Hard stop at 6 PM regardless of development progress
- **Documentation**: Keep detailed notes of technical decisions for future team members
- **MVP Mindset**: Focus on working prototype over perfect features
