# Comprehensive Business Execution Plan: Sustainable Path to $1M ARR by 2026
*Integrating Wellness Framework with Revenue Operations Strategy*

## Executive Summary

This plan delivers a systematic approach to scale Bookcast and Softprobe from current state to $1M ARR by 2026, with a sustainable path to $500M by 2030.
