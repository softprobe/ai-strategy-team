## Remember: Start Small, Build Consistently

The key to success is consistency over perfection. Focus on:
1. **One change at a time** until it becomes automatic
2. **Progress over perfection** - 80% consistency beats 100% for 3 days then quitting
3. **Family involvement** - make them partners, not victims of your schedule
4. **Energy first** - all business success flows from sustained personal energy

**Your first step**: Set your wake-up time for tomorrow and prepare your workout clothes tonight. Everything else builds from consistent mornings.

The aggressive business goals (1M ARR by 2026, 500M by 2030) are absolutely achievable with these systems. The difference is you'll reach them with your health and family intact, creating a foundation for long-term success rather than short-term achievement followed by collapse.

Start tomorrow morning. Your future self and your family will thank you.
